There are two datasets:

- `indsamlers` Each row is an "indsamler" (the one who goes around collecting money). There are four variables:
    + `hjerterstarterid`: The organizing group ID. Those with group ID == 0 do not belong to any hjerterstarter group.
    + `indsamlerid`: The ID unique to each person going around collecting money
    + `ruteid`: The ID of the route. One indsamler can do >1 routes
    + `indtastningstidspunkt`: The date-time that the indsamler was registered via HF's website  
    
       <br/>
- `groups` Each row is a hjerterstarter group to which indsamlers belong. There are two variables:s
    + `hjertestarterid`: The organizing group ID - links to the `indsamlers` dataset
    + `antal_ruter_med_hjerteid`: The number of routes each group actually achieved on the event day
